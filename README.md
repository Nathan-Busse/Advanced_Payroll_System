# Advanced_Payroll_System
The main aim of this Pay Roll System project is have a fully automated pay-roll system. This fully user friendly software will make the whole pay-roll system speedier and will guarantee on time salary to employees without any redundancy and delays. Moreover, it will certainly reduce the time, money and effort wasted in manual searching for leaves, deductions, grade allocation and designation allocation.  Pay Roll System Project  Existing System The Existing Pay Roll System is in fact very slow and highly delays prone. As the data stored is done manually, it takes a lot of time to process any query regarding information of any employee. The financial head has to search for a particular employee grade, leaves, designation and calculate the deductions before issuing him the pay slip. It requires huge man power if the organization is having a good number of employees. Due to manual operations, inconsistency in data management may prevail which can create faulty pay slips.     Proposed system The proposed Pay Roll System software will remove any kind of redundancies and inconsistencies prevailing in the existing system by providing a fully computerized pay roll management system. The Pay Roll System will hold all the employeeâ€™s personal details, along with his grade, designation, leaves and other deductions. The reports and the pay slips can be generated with a single mouse click. The GUI of the software is very user friendly, easy to navigate and can easily be managed by a non tech-savvy person.
